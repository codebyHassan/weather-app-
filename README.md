🌤️ Excited to Share My Latest Project! 🌦️
I’ve recently developed a Weather Web App using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap! This project allows users to enter any city name and instantly receive real-time weather details such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and more — all powered by a Weather API.
💡 Key Features:
Search weather by city name 🌍
Real-time temperature and weather condition updates 📊
Clean and responsive UI with Bootstrap 💻
Fully functional backend using Django and Python 🐍
This project helped me deepen my understanding of API integration, backend logic, and responsive front-end design. It's a small but practical tool that demonstrates how simple tech stacks can solve everyday problems.
Feel free to check it out or give feedback — always open to learning and improving!
